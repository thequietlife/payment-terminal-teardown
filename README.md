### Ingenico iPP350 teardown

I have been wanting to tear a device apart to get a better understanding of how things work, like PCBs. I stumbled upon a article by [Interrupt Labs](https://www.interruptlabs.co.uk/articles/dissection-of-a-payment-terminal) and thought it was a perfect one to do. My first task was finding the Ingenico iPP350. I wanted one with a plug so I could have the screen working. Thanks ebay you rock.
